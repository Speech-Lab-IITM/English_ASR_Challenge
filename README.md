# IIT MADRAS SPEECH LAB'S ENGLISH ASR CHALLENGE

This challenge is the second ASR challenge in the series of challenges to be organized by Speech Lab, IIT Madras.

## Data Set and Baseline recipes

The data set comprises of Indian English read speech and conversational speech data along with the corresponding transcriptions. It covers genres like politics, sports, entertainment, etc. The read speech text data was crawled from newspapers, and then volunteers were asked to read them. The conversational speech data was obtained from the Computer Science and Electrical lectures of NPTEL. The read speech corpus is referred to with a suffix **_IITM_** whereas the conversational speech corpus is referred to with suffix **_NPTEL_**. The following data sets will be released as a part of this challenge

|Set|Duration(hrs)|Source|Type|
|---|-------------|------|-----|
|train_IITM_NPTEL| 280|IITM + NPTEL|read and converstional|
|dev_IITM|6|IITM|read|
|dev_NPTEL|5|NPTEL|conversational|
|eval_IITM|6|IITM|read|
|eval_NPTEL|5|NPTEL|conversational|

Lexicon, results and recipes to replicate the baseline experiments have also been made available.
