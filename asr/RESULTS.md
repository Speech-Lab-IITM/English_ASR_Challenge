# Baseline Results

**NOTE**: We used a train set comprising of both NPTEL and IITM English data. Evaluations were performed on NPTEL and IITM development sets by considering them seperately.

The baseline results(% WERs) are as follows. All the triphone models were trained using 7000 senones and 20 gaussians per seonone.

|Model|DEV_IITM|DEV_NPTEL|
|-----|--------|---------|
Tri1(7000-20) | 16.72  | 23.50 |
Tri2(7000-20) | 16.24  | 22.14 |
Tri3(7000-20) | 15.58  | 21.70 |
**TDNN**          |  **6.65**  | **13.08** |
